>“The most fundamental principle of the organized mind, the one most critical to keeping us from forgetting or losing things, is to shift the burden of organizing from our brains to the external world.” -Daniel J. Levitin

### Overview
This app was created to provide a simple interactive note taker that saves user input to a server, so it may be accessed on any device.

### Installation
Run `npm install` on your computer while within the projects directory. Use `npm start` to run your server and navigate to `http://localhost:<server-port-number>`, making sure that you are looking for the correct port.

### Usage

At the landing page of the application, click `Get Started` to navigate to the notes page. From there, you may type in a title and text into the cooresponding fields. To save your note, click the save icon in the top right of the browser. From there, your task will save. Click on the pencil icon to create a new note.
